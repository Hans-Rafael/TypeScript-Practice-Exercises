# TypeScript Practice Exercises

Welcome to the **TypeScript Practice Exercises** repository! This project is designed to help you improve and solidify your knowledge of JavaScript and TypeScript through hands-on exercises. The exercises are divided into three levels: **Basic**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**, each focusing on key concepts and skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

```
typescript-practice-exercises/
â”œâ”€â”€ basic/         # Basic level exercises
â”œâ”€â”€ intermediate/  # Intermediate level exercises
â”œâ”€â”€ advanced/      # Advanced level exercises
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md      # Documentation (this file)
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json  # TypeScript configuration file
```

Each directory contains individual files for exercises, with clear instructions and comments in the code.

## tsconfig.json

The repository includes a pre-configured `tsconfig.json` file to ensure consistent TypeScript settings:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "include": ["./**/*.ts"]
}
```

Feel free to modify it as needed for your experiments.
